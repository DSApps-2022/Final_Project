# DSApps @ TAU 2020: Final Project

### Welcome to the Final Project!

In general:

1. You need to have your own private repo of the final project.
2. Clone this repo locally.
3. Start and fill your project notebook(s).
4. Push the repo back to Github before due date. If you've submitted early, might want to ping me.
5. You're done. :nail_care:
